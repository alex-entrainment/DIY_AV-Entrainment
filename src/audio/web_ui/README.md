# Web UI for the Realtime Backend

This directory provides a minimal browser interface for the Rust audio engine
when compiled to WebAssembly. It is meant for quick experimentation directly
from a web page.

## Building the WebAssembly Package

1. Install [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/).
2. Build the backend with the `web` feature enabled:
   ```bash
   cd ../realtime_backend
   wasm-pack build --target web --release --no-default-features --features web
   ```
3. Copy the generated `pkg` folder into `public/` so Vite can serve
    `realtime_backend.js` and `realtime_backend_bg.wasm`.

## Running the Demo

Install the npm dependencies and start the development server. **Vite 5 requires Node.js 20 or newer**, so ensure you have an up-to-date Node.js installation:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite will serve the application at the printed URL. You can either paste a track
JSON object into the text box or use the **Upload** field to load a `.json`
file. Click **Start** to begin playback and **Stop** to halt the engine.

The JavaScript code now creates the `AudioContext` using the `sample_rate`
specified in the track JSON (falling back to `44100` if not provided). This
prevents pitch or tempo shifts when the track was rendered for a different
sample rate than your browser's default.

### Low Latency AudioWorklet

The demo uses an `AudioWorklet` and a shared ring buffer to stream audio samples
generated by the WASM module. The main thread fills the buffer using
`process_block` while the worklet reads from it inside the audio callback. This
approach avoids large memory allocations and provides lower latency than the old
`ScriptProcessor` implementation.
